# What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. It was designed to interoperate fully with Java and is commonly used for Android app development. Kotlin is known for its conciseness, safety, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers. It is also used for server-side development, multiplatform mobile development, and data science tasks.

# Overview
The X-O Game Project is a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as X-O, that can be played both offline and online. The game allows two players to compete against each other, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Project Description
This project includes two parts of the game, online and offline.
 For the online part, Firestore has been used as a database, which is one of the services provided by Firebase. In this mode of the game, a player who starts the game gives the generated random code to his partner and the other party enters the created game space by entering that code.
